## AWS CDK Notices

A static website for the distribution of [structured information][1] that we want to
broadcast to AWS CDK users. This information can be used in different ways. For
example, it can be consumed by the CDK CLI to display messages to users on every
command, or it can be used by a GitHub workflow to update issues.
